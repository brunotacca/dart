/** https://github.com/thatisuday/dart-getting-started-guide/blob/master/
 * A string interpolation is process of getting final string value by evaluating,
 * a string that contains variables and expressions.
 *
 * String interpolation in Dart can be performed directly by using `$variable` syntax
 * inside `single` or `double` quoted string as well as using `${variable}` or `${expression}` syntax.
 *
 * Any object of other than `String` type that is being interpolated in a string,
 * must have `toString` method which returns a string prepresentation of that object.
