/**
 * If you aware of JavaScript `Promise` object then you can relate it to the `Future` object.
 * A `Future` object is used to handle asynchronous operations.
 * A `Future` object is created by passing an `executor` function to the `Future` class constructor.
 * 
 * The job of `executor` function is to trigger a background process and
 * return the result of the background job.
 *
 * A `Future` object has `then` and `catchError` method.
 * `then` method it used to register a callback function when `executor` function returns a value.
 * `catchError` method is used to register a callback function when an exception was thrown in the `executor` function.
 *
 * The `executor` function starts executing when the `Future` object is registered with a callback
 * using `then` or `catchError` method. It will also execute if the `Future` object is used as an expression.
 *
 * When `then` callback is called, we call `Future` object was successfully `resolved`.
 * When `catchError` callback is called, we call `Future` object was `rejected` or `failed`.
 *
 * `Future` object does not block the execution of the program until it is resolved or rejected.
